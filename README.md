#Funstagram

A weeks 8-10 Makers Academy project in creating an Instagram clone. An exercise in practising a number of previously-unexplored technologies, including Websockets, Google Maps, Email, Stripe, Paperclip and Bootstrap. As an extension, I added more social functionality, such as following and a rudimentary news-feed.

##Objectives
